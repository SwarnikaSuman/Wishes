  <h1>Hello Friends</h1>
  <p>Here, you can wish your friends and family on different ocassions like Birthdays, Festivals etc.
    For that you will have to know how add text in html so, I will be giving a short tutorial on how to do that.
    Here you don't have to login or signup that is why by using this even the ones those who don't have an email id can also wish their friends.
    Just you have to edit this file and send the link to your friends.
    If you don't like the style your wish is being sent, then give your messege a class and then style it it css.
    I will be telling how to do that also.</p>
